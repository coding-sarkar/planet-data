# PLANET DATA

This is the [table assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data) from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).


## PROJECT BRIEF
You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal â€” you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table.
